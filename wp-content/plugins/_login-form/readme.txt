= What is Authorization? =
<p>We all have met this procedure in our Internet life on the pages of service e-mails, social networks, or at the message boards. To authorize means that you simply need to enter a correct login and password, following which all site possibilities will be reachable for you, such as access to its content, message sending and comment posting on discussion forums or web-blogs. Thus, authorization is a procedure of resource authentication. As a rule, passing of this procedure is not difficult, though there are many exceptions, when only a specific circle of users can log in to the website.</p>

= Steps of Authorization Process =
<p>While registration, a user fills in his login form (a real name or a made up nickname), password and e-mail address. Password can be generated automatically and may be sent to an e-mail. These three elements are obligatory and used on every website. Besides using them a resource manager has a right to make a user to write his additional personal info (like gender, age, real name, phone number and so forth). That can be necessary due to different reasons.<br />
Authorization identifies a person through [login form](https://wordpress.org/plugins/login-form/) and allows web admin to recognize a conversation partner or a client.</p>

= Pros to use Login Form =
<p>As you may see, login form plugin enables user identification on a site and at the same time limits access permission to its selected sections and options for unauthorized users. So, from the standpoints of both a site holder and web surfer you can have some serious reservations: Is there a necessity to restrict access by dint of authorization? Would it be better to open up the possibilities to each and every of users according to the fact that they do not appreciate making extra procedures even if they take only few minutes? Plus free access is really more favorable for users, and their comfort is the foundation of long-term relationships.<br />
Of course, it would be great to refuse from employing of such measures. But still, authorization is the thing that can partially protect the site owner and visitors from spam (it is a mail out of commercial or any other type of advertisement to people, who don’t want to receive it). Spam is usually sent by special programs – spam bots, which automatically post comments with adverts and links on any sources, where it’s possible to do. You can shield your resource through different methods and logging in is the most practical of them.<br />
The second equally important aim of authorization is gathering of information about a person, his identification. Certainly, this data is presented voluntarily by people and it is used purely for purposes of recognition by other visitants. If this is about e-commerce site then authorization improves greatly site usability, because a visitor gets his or her personal page with his history of orders, in his shopping cart there is previously saved info about wares he picked earlier, and there is no need to fill the checkout form again.<br />
Sure thing, authorization has many other functions and tasks, but these two are of the utter importance.</p>

= Pros from Login Form to a Site Holder =
After such close details search let’s make a brief list of advantages that you and your website visitor can get by registration. So, being a concerned site holder you can get:<br />
1. Spam filtration (the sufficient part of spam bots is eliminated);<br />
2. Possibility to identify visitors, which in its turn provide:<br />
<ul><li>More demographic, geographic information about attendants that gives an opportunity to make better settings in the system of contextual advertising and to pick the optimal key words in terms of site promotion;</li>
<li>Capacity to provide more services (as the example such further functions: inter-office mail, saving of history of orders and other), which allow to improve usability by magnetizing of more regular customers;</li>
<li>Control of right to use the content or its part (for non-commercial websites that is of a low value, while for the opposite type of resources it is vital).</li>
</ul>
<br />
And now let’s enumerate maybe not obvious but still important advantages of logging for Internet users:<br />
1. The same spam protection;<br />
2. Possibility to meet familiar interlocutor again. To identify each other users do not need to introduce themselves each time, they just need to authorize;<br />
3. Bonus features on the website.<br />

= 'Custom Login Form' for WordPress Websites = 
<p>That is the name of extremely helpful and practical plugin for WordPress sites (we refer to them as Wordpress is the most popular content management system).
